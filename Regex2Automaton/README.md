# Regex2Automaton
#The code was written as a part of my programming assignment during my time at Indian Institute of Science(IISc). The function returns an NFA for corresponding regex.
The assignment included mostly included the idea that I write a code to generate NFA(utils.py) and main.py will test if the generated NFA is correct or not. Input.txt contains the data about regex, words belonging/not belonging to the language of the grammer. Similarly, expOutput.txt contains the actual binary answer.

I personally belive if one has confirmed the idea of the code, one can just use utils.py to generate an NFA for a given regex and text if any word belongs to the language of the regex.
